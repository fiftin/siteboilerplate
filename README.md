| Bulma                  | UI Framework    |

### How setup should works

_NOT IMPLEMENTED!!! you should do it manually_

1. Ask the user to the AWS access key. (required)

2. Ask the user to the AWS access secret (required)

3. Ask the user to a domain name (optional)
    With using Terraform:
    * Create S3 bucket
    * Create Lambda@Edge
    * Requst SSL Certificate (if domain name provided)
    * Create CloudFront distribution

4. Ask the user to add a CNAME record to confirm domain owning (if domain name provided)

5. Waiting domain confirmation (if domain name provided)

6. Setup successfully finished

7. Destroy all resources if the user canceled setup

### Recomendations

Use Cloudflare to protect your website from DDoS attacks.

Create a fork to start using the boilerplate.
